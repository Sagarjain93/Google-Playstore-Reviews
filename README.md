**Key areas explored:**

*  Distribution of apps across categories

*   Free vs Paid apps analysis

*   Impact of app size and price on popularity

*   User sentiments aggregated by app and category

*   Top categories by installs and reviews

**Key Observations**

*  Free apps dominate (most installs, wider reach) while paid apps are niche.

*  App size doesn’t strongly affect installs, but extremely large apps are less popular.

*  User sentiment polarity gives additional context beyond ratings (e.g., some apps have average ratings but highly positive/negative reviews).

*  Games, Communication, and Tools lead in installs, while Family and Education categories dominate by volume.

**Tools & Libraries Used**

*  Python 

*  Pandas, NumPy → Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

*  Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data Visualization


**Business Impact**

*  Helps developers optimize pricing, size, and features based on market trends.

*  Businesses can identify profitable app categories and areas of improvement.

*  Provides insights into user satisfaction and engagement via sentiment analysis.

*  Supports data-driven decision-making for app marketing and updates.

**Conclusion**

*  This EDA provides actionable insights into what drives app success in the Google Play Store.
*  By combining app metadata with user sentiments, we highlight both quantitative and qualitative factors that influence installs and ratings, helping stakeholders better understand the dynamics of the app marketplace.
